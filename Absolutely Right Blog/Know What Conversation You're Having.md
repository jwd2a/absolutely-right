When you're discussing a project or something with someone - a client, a teammate, whoever - you have to make sure you're having the same conversation. Having different conversations, while *thinking* you're having the same conversation is the cause of a litany of misunderstandings. 

I tend to think of conversations in progressive levels. As you go down this list, it's important to make sure you have alignment on each item, at least generally, before moving to the next. The cause of many misunderstandings is jumping to a level further down that you're currently solving.

If you're not aligned on the goal of what you're doing, the reason for things to exist in the first place, then there's no sense in talking about how you'll do it, what color the font should be, or what phone number people will call for help. We're not there yet, we'll get there. 

When you solve things, you have to remember to go through layers of detail successively, deferring concrete details until more abstract ones have been solved.
