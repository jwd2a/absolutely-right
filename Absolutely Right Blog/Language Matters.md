I think if we want agentic tools to be taken seriously as a means of building products, we have to stop calling it "vibe coding". 

I love the name as much as anyone else, but the fact is, it portrays a type of engineering that's just too loose, too free, to be taken seriously. 

Anyone who has seriously gone deep into agentic engineering and made it work well knows that it's far from "vibing", it's real engineering done in a new way. Context management, tool management, agentic workflows, CI/CD management - this is _way_ more than "write a prompt get a thing".

I tend to gravitate toward the term "agentic engineering" right now because it captures the two things that I think are really key: it's driven by agents predominantly, and it's _engineering._ Engineering is more secure, more scalable and more trustworthy than "coding". I can feel you rolling your eyes.

Call bullshit all you want, but language matters, and these semantics change the perception of what you're representing. If you want someone to take it seriously, stop calling it "vibe coding".
